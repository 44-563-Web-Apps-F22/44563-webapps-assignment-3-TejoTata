        <h1> Tejo Lakshmi Tata </h1>
        <p>I'm Tejo Lakshmi Tata, and I was born and raised in Bapatla, which is well-known for having <br>Suryalanka Beach. I attended Gems High School and Graduated in 2021 from Vignan's 
         Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research. I enjoy playing video games and am <br> really interested in yoga when I have free time.</p>
         <h4>My favourite movie is Bahubali</h4>
         <p>A visual treat.If a person is bit of into movies, I am sure that person heard about Baahubali
            couple of years back. It took almost four years to complete the first part. Hero Prabhas had
            completely dedicated his time to this movie and no movie after his super successful movie 
            Mirchi. Same is true from S.S Rajamouly, after his last non-conventional movie Eega. So 
            obviously there are high expectations 3 years of sheer hard-work of many people who have 
            worked their hearts out for this. </p>
